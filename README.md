# 🧱DevOps/Cloud Engineering > WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LEMP STACK)
🛠️ **DEVELOPMENT**

The LEMP stack is a collection of open-source software components that work together to host and run dynamic websites and web applications. It is similar to the LAMP stack, but replaces Apache with Nginx, a high-performance web server.🔥

L → Linux: The operating system that provides the foundation.

E → Nginx: The web server that efficiently handles client requests and delivers web content.

M → MySQL: The relational database system for storing and managing application data.

P → PHP: The server-side scripting language that powers the application logic.
